## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?




## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- when conflic arises team members will ensure they reach out to another team member for mediation on the issue. Once the issue is understood and a decission can be made the ultimate decission will be made by the team instead of a singular person. We will ensure that during project week we do not create a hostile work environment and if there is one it shoulld be brought up for everyone to aknowledge. 

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- If one person is taking over the project then it shoudl be the responsability of the rest of the team to approach that person so that everyone is allowed a chance to contribute to this project. 

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Our approach is to initially ask everyone to identify their weak and strong areas for this project assignment and be able to pair those people who have identified improvement areas with those who are confident in those areas.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Everyone should be aware of their contributions but we will use gitbub commit histories to inform everyone of the possible lack of contributions.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- In the event any team member is not satisfied with the teams decission of any issues the team member will be welcomed to contact staff for conflic resolution or any person that would look at the issue in an unbiased manner. 

Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?
- 
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
 - Slack
 - Remo
 - Github
How often will you take breaks?
- Once an hour for 10 minutes or as necessary 
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- If we were to fall behind we will make sure we utilize TAs and instructors to get us back on track. If we are not on track after a day we will make sure we update the instructor to find a resolution. 
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- We will communicate as necessary through the use of Slack.
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- We will have daily standup meetings and ensure we are getting every persons feedback on this project
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- The team will have an open approach to constructive critisism and if something needs to be said PMs will be used to bring it up to that team member and bring it up to their attention. If direct communication does not work the team may have to get involved to settle the matter. 


## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
-Each person will work on one file at a time. If two people are working on the same file each will have to communicate when they will create a pull request and agree on the area of code that will be worked on. Once the initial person is done a pull request will be done from main and the second person will then create a pull request. Also, at the end of every day all pull requests need to be made and new pull origin mains will be done at the begining of every day.
